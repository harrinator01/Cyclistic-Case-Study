This is a project I did as a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The project examines real data from a bicycle-sharing platform in Chicago to inform strategy for the bicycle-sharing company.

The accompanying powerpoint is the easiest to place to start in order to get a sense of the project.
The case study PDF also does a good job of explaining what's been asked.

Along with the above files, you'll also find the code I wrote, the visuals generated, and (some of) the raw data.
Many of the data files were too large to upload, but you'll be able to follow along with a few months of data.
